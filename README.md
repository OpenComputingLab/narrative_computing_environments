# narrative_computing_environments

A review of several different environments that can be used to present narrative views over executable code.

- Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab 
- VS Code notebooks
- Quarto / RMarkdown documents

Considerations:

- document formats
- code execution environments
- code editing and code edit persistence
- document editing and document persistence
- static rendering of executed documents
- production environments
- end user presentation environments
